/**
 * Implicit placement policy for items.
 * There are two major types of settings here: the main axis of placement presented by the [mainAxis]
 * property and the direction of placement presented by [horizontalDirection] and [verticalDirection] properties.
 *
 * The [mainAxis] property describes which axis would be used to find the next position.
 * For example, [MainAxis.HORIZONTAL] means that firstly next position will look in a current row
 * and if there isn't a place for the item algorithm will move to the next row.
 *
 * The [horizontalDirection] property describes the direction for choosing the next item on the
 * horizontal axis: left or right side, depending on LTR or RTL settings.
 *
 * The [verticalDirection] property describes the direction for choosing the next item on the vertical
 * axis: above or below.
 *
 * @param mainAxis the main axis for selecting the next location
 * @param horizontalDirection horizontal placement policy
 * @param verticalDirection vertical placement policy
